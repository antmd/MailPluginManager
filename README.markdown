## BundleManager - Mail Plugin Manager

BundleManager is a tool to help Mac Mail bundle authors manage, install & keep up to date for their users.

### Main Features

* Installation
* Uninstallation
* Automatic Updates
* Checks for compatibility of plugins at boot time (i.e. after an install)
* Sends crash reports back to developer
* Determine relevant information about the user's system (Mail, Message, etc.)

### Still to do (mostly notes for me)

* Rethink the status, enabled, inLocalDomain properties.
* Load historicalUUIDs file from remote server on launch (MBM & MBT)
* Use synchronized file features in Lion when we can for historicalUUIDs
* Setup system to report system setup when requested by user/developer.
* Draw Border in the MailBundleView based on status and compatibility (green, light grey, red)
* Set color of latest version text to green (?) if there is an update & enable button
* Change color of text for company to blue to indicate link (too many colors?)
* Add a link directly to product for Name & Icon.

### How to use
